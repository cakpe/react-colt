Typical react app layout:
There is usually an app component -- in index.js. It is typically the one js file that is rendered
into the DOM -- It has the render return syntax:
    render() {
        return (

        )
    }
It is like the entry point into our code.

-------------------------------
***PROPS ARE IMMUTABLE. You can't manually change them (only through state and re-rendering)
when you're passing props, you don't have to use the curly braces if they're strings; you do so
otherwise.
